# Hello-World
This is my hello world.  Not quite sure what im going to do with it yet but i know i'll use it eventually
I'm on a journey to disover new things. I've decided to learn a little bit about linux. I
'm basically just learing bits off of youtube so far. So if anyone for some reason reads this and wants to help me on my journey, maybe teach me a little about github and or linux, feel free to reach out.
